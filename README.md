# Heat-Stroke-Prevention-Vest

## Project Overview

This project is a part of my capstone course: IGEN 230 where I successfully pitched the idea to create a heat stroke prevention vest and ranked in the top 10/62 proposals. Working with a team of 6 engineering students, I received $200 to develop a preventative vest that lowers the user's core body temperature by 3.8Â°C once they are at risk of having a heat stroke.

## Code

The code in this repository is used to control all of the pinch valves on our vest as well as to gather data from our sensors in order to detect whether or not the user is at risk of having heat stroke. We performed additional analysis outside of this code repository in order to generate an equation to determine heat stroke risk based on data from the National Health Institute.
